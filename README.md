# Hello there, I'm Mairis!👋🏻👩🏻‍🦱

### I am a front-end developer.

My first approach to programming happened when I was a high school student and today, as a front-end developer my passion is to face challenges by creating experiences that provide value and service to people, while empathizing with their needs through code.

Here you can join me during my journey as a front-end developer trainee as I prepare to take on new challenges and gain more knowledge to bring my passion to people and organizations, while maintaining a stable relationship with Javascript. 🧑🏻‍💻✍🏻
